# Ethereum Handbook
- Ethereum is a transaction system that can be used to send & receive internet money called Ether.
- Ethereum have two entities which are smart-contracts & accounts.
- Smart-contracts are computer code that could be executed on a blockchain virtual machine such as Ethereum.
- Accounts are addresses and keys (like your house address and keys).
- A Token Contract is a specific type of Smart Contract that describes (using the contract code) rules of how the token could be generated, transferred between addresses, is it splittable/fungible, etc. On Ethereum, all tokens are contracts, but not all contracts are tokens.
